# password-generator-AWY

## Description


In this assignment we were to write javascript code that worked with the provided html and css code to build a random password generator. The random generator had to meet specific criteria. When the 
generate code button is clicked the user is presented with a series of  five prompts providing the user with a series of character options for the password. The first prompt directs the user to choose a password length between 8 - 128 characters. If the password does not meet the length requirements, the user is again alerted to choose a password between 8 - 128 characters. The user is then presented the options to use upper casse letters, lower case letters, characters, and numbers. The password is then generated based on the user selected criteria.
